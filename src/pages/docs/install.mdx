```sh
# download it to `./vestauth`
curl -sfS --proto '=https' https://vestauth.sh/$(uname)/$(uname -m).tgz | tar xz

# install it to `/usr/local/bin/vestauth`
sudo install -m 755 vestauth /usr/local/bin

# check it works
vestauth help
```

Download a specific version:

```sh
# download version 0.7.0
curl -sfS --proto '=https' "https://vestauth.sh/$(uname)/$(uname -m).tgz?version=v0.7.0" | tar xz

# check the version
./vestauth --version
```

<Note>
  You can view available versions at [github.com/vestauth/releases](https://github.com/vestauth/releases/tree/main)

### Npm local

{
  "scripts": {
    "curl": "./node_modules/.bin/vestauth agent curl"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vestauth": "^0.7.0"
  }
}
```

### Npm global

You can also install globally using npm's `--global` flag.

```

### Npx

Or prefer to run as needed, uses `npx`.

```bash

```

### pkgx

[pkgx](https://pkgx.sh) is a single, standalone binary that can run anything. Since it can run anything, it can run `vestauth`:

```sh
pkgx npx vestauth help
```
